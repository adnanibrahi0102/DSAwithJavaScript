# Array Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) Questions

### Array Sum

Given an array of integers, find the sum of all elements.

### Array Product

Given an array of integers, find the product of all elements.

### Array Max/Min

Find the maximum or minimum element in an array.

### Array Average

Calculate the average of all elements in an array.

### Array Reverse

Reverse the elements of an array.

### Array Rotation

Rotate the elements of an array to the left or right by a given number of steps.

### Array Sorting

Sort the elements of an array in ascending or descending order.

### Array Unique Elements

Remove duplicates from an array and return a new array with only unique elements.

### Array Intersection/Union

Given two arrays, find their intersection (common elements) or union (all elements).

### Array Subarray/Subsequence

Find the maximum/minimum sum of a contiguous subarray or the longest increasing subsequence.

### Array Partitioning

Partition an array into two subsets such that the absolute difference of their sums is minimized.

### Array Traversal

Traverse an array and perform a specific operation on each element (e.g., doubling each element).

### Array Frequency Count

Count the frequency of each element in an array and return a frequency map.

### Array Prefix/Suffix Sum

Calculate prefix or suffix sums of an array, where each element represents the sum of elements up to that index.

### Array Sliding Window

Find the maximum/minimum sum/product within a fixed-size subarray (window) sliding across the array.

### Array Missing Element

Find the missing element from an array containing elements from a continuous sequence.

### Array Subsets

Generate all possible subsets of an array or check if one array is a subset of another.

### Array Operations

Perform various operations on arrays, such as concatenation, splitting, or merging.

### Array Target Sum

Given an array of integers and a target sum, find pairs of elements that sum up to the target.

### Array Element Swap

Swap elements at given positions within an array.
